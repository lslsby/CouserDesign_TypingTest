The U.S. space shuttle Discovery has launched on a mission to deliver new components to the International Space Station.  Shuttle Discovery left behind a pink and gold plume of smoke as it took off Sunday evening, with the sun setting on the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. "Booster ignition and lift off for space shuttle Discovery, taking the space station to full power for full science," said a ground controller.
