The preparation for becoming an astronaut actually begins in elementary school. "It is here that the foundations are laid down and then built upon," comments Colonel Charlie Bolden, Deputy Commandant of Midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy. "Start with the basics and get them down first ... you can't do anything without math and science." At this level, students should read everything they can get their hands on about astronauts and space in general. Later, once they have found a specific field of interest, they can begin to focus on that.

But there's more than book learning involved. Other skills Bolden feels are integral to becoming an astronaut are: being able to work as a team player; understanding and appreciating your ethnic, cultural, and American history; and maintaining a grasp on current events.

Bolden does not hold the opinion that America's young people are less equipped than their foreign counterparts. "I listen to people say that American students can't do this and can't do that. I don't buy into or accept that at all. Kids are just as sharp as when I came up. It's just motivation that may be lacking," Bolden said.

It is also interesting to note that out of 195 former and present astronauts, 123 (64%) have taken part in some form of scouting. Scouting develops a sense of discipline, as well as particular skills. Both are crucial to becoming part of the astronaut team.

Once students reach high school, it is particularly important that they earn the best possible grades as well as high standardized test scores (SAT and/or ACT). NASA looks for the best and the brightest, so it makes sense that they would look at how well students apply themselves to their studies. At this point, too, students should begin to think about a specific direction of study, such as engineering, biological or physical science, or mathematics. This will help them direct their education once they get to college.

Again, though, books are only part of the process. It's a good idea to look for out-of-school opportunities like internships or apprenticeships, summer programs, and fieldwork, to help balance textbook learning. After all, going into space is a real-world -- not a virtual -- experience; the more experience you bring to it, the better you'll be able to deal with the demands of the job. Internships are also a good way of finding out if your career choice is the right one for you. Many students, when faced with the realities of a particular field, decide it's not what they wanted, after all. It's better to decide early on that this is the case, before you devote a lot of time and effort to something you don't enjoy.

But choose your activities wisely. "If you do things thinking that, 'This will look good on a resume, or 'I'm not going to like it but it'll help me get selected someday,' you will do yourself a disservice. You're not going to do as well as you would at something in which you're interested," said Reightler.

The "minimum degree requirement" for an astronaut is a Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution. Three years of related increasingly responsible professional experience must follow that degree. Most astronauts to date, however, have continued with their education to the post-graduate (Master's and Ph.D.) levels; they have been able to substitute that education for all or part of their work experience requirement.

NASA contributes funds to 51 colleges and universities through its Space Grant Consortia. If you attend one of these institutions, you are ensured that the curriculum for space programs will conform with the guidelines NASA finds acceptable. However, you can attend any college or university that you wish, since almost all offer degrees in technical fields, math, and science. You should check with a guidance/college counselor -- and NASA -- before you go to confirm that the school will offer the subjects you need.
