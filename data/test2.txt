Regardless of which school you do attend, you once again need to go for the grades. For one thing, you will need them to be accepted into a good Master's program. And for another, NASA needs applicants who can demonstrate success at the higher-education levels.

Math and science are obviously critical to becoming an astronaut, but they are not the only subjects you will need to get where you're going. English -- an ability to communicate, both written and verbally -- is also vital. So is history, not just of the space program, but of the world. And Bolden, who had to wake up extra early to attend a class in basic Russian language to prepare for his mission with a cosmonaut, suggests that every American should be -- at the very least -- bilingual.

"Space," he says, "is a multinational and multicultural operation. Working with Russian cosmonauts is very difficult if astronauts don't know anything about Russian culture and their history as a people." This is also increasingly true as construction of the International Space Station gets underway.

But, says Dr. Ellen Ochoa, a Mission Specialist and the first Hispanic woman in space, "there isn't one particular type of work experience that NASA is looking for. NASA -- like any other employer -- wants to know how well a person has done. If you come from a research background, they'd look at published work in technical journals, lecturing or TA experience, and also any awards that you may have won. Everyone should have summer jobs. You need some sort of experience."

College-level experience will also help you to understand what particular companies are looking for in terms of hiring policies and experience levels. And many students are offered jobs, either when their internship is completed or upon graduation.

So now that you've got the degree and some experience, how do you qualify to become an astronaut? The first step is to fill out an application -- specifically, U.S. Government Form 171, which you send to the Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas. There it will be reviewed and ranked according to height considerations (you must be at least 58.5 inches), experience, and expertise (i.e. geologists, physicists, chemists, biologists etc.). The competition is fierce -- about 4,000 individuals apply every two years, and the slots are limited.

And if the applicant is looking for a pilot/commander position in the program, then he/she must also be prepared to log in at least 1,000 hours of flight time in command of a jet aircraft prior to consideration. Most of the current and former pilot/commander positions have been filled historically by men who have served or are currently active in the United States Armed Forces. There are only a few exceptions. During training all crew members will train aboard a T-38 jet. The controls are identical to that of the Space Shuttle and, therefore, the jet can be used as a flight simulator either on the ground or in actual flight.

Once the initial ranking is complete, the applications go through a second, more stringent, round to narrow down the field. From the initial 4,000 applicants, only about 118 are asked to come to the JSC and undergo a week of interviews, medical examinations, and basic orientation.

Ochoa noted that the Astronaut Selection Board (ASB) generally looks for people who have done very well in a technical field. And very well does not mean just their grades -- candidates should make sure they have sterling recommendations, especially from undergraduate and graduate school professors who can attest to their problem solving abilities, communication skills, and their ability to work well as part of a team.

The ASB interviews each person and assigns him or her a rating based on: experience and potential, motivation, ability to function as a member of a team, communication skills, and adaptability. Applicants who have impeccable school records and plenty of outside experience but who do not possess the required interpersonal skills for the position, may be rejected solely on that basis. Being an astronaut really means being part of a team.

A significant number of applicants do not meet medical standards, and still others withdraw after gaining a complete understanding of the very demanding job. Based on the information collected during this investigation, ASB will choose its final candidates and pass that recommendation on to the NASA Administrator; he or she will make the final choices. Once selected, candidates begin a rigorous training program.

As with any other career, being an astronaut has drawbacks. One commonly shared among astronauts is the intense workload and the lack of time for their families. "With this job you could work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and still not get everything done. You have to strike a balance--that is the key," says Reightler. "There can be long hours that are unpredictable. Travel is involved especially during the busiest times -- three months before and two months after a launch," agreed Ochoa.

And if an applicant has hopes for a large salary -- say, comparable to those in the private sector -- they should look elsewhere. Astronauts begin their salary in accordance with the U.S. Government pay scale at GS-11 status (approximately $39,000) and top off at GS-14 status (approximately $78,000). That's not a whole lot for a dangerous job. But for those who dream of going into space, the pay is one of the lesser considerations.
